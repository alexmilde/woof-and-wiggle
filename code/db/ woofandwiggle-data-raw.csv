Keep your four-legged friend dry and clean with our anorak in the usual woof &amp; wiggle quality. The hoodie and lining are in contrasting colors, the hood and the back are adjustable with a rubber cord in orange. Of course with a hole for a collar and a pocket with Velcro for snacks on the back. The jacket is closed with Velcro on the stomach and neck. We use high-quality polyester ripstop fabric, which is very water-repellent and dirt-repellent thanks to the checkerboard structure. The material dries quickly and can be stowed away to save space.</p>
<p><strong>Easy maintenance</strong> <br />Care is also very simple: machine wash at 30 ° C, do not tumble dry, do not iron, do not dry clean. It is recommended to renew the impregnation from time to time during the wash cycle.</p>

<strong> Manufacturing </strong>
The chains are hand made in our hamburger woof &amp; amp; wiggle atelier.

<strong> Material </strong>
The collars are equipped with so-called EM ceramic pipes. These are small ceramic tubes that are burned from clay mixed with EM <strong> (Effective Microorganisms) </strong>. EM ceramics builds up an anti-tick environment in dogs.

<strong>Size choice
</strong> The chains are available in 4 different sizes threaded on leather cord. When choosing the size, we recommend using the size of the normal dog collar and not too long.

<strong>Application</strong>
The collar should be worn continuously or as long as possible during the tick season in order to build up good protection. After about four weeks, the collar can also be removed at night. But please note that protection against ticks with alternative means can of course not be 100% guaranteed.

<strong>Care instructions</strong>
For optimal effectiveness against ticks, the collar should be washed with water and dried in the sun every four weeks.",https://woofandwiggle.com/shop/uncategorized/katsuki-em-dog-collar-against-ticks/

Your Chihuahua finds wet and cold just as uncomfortable as you. Because especially small dogs or four-legged friends with short fur suffer quickly from it. That is why we developed our Polartec® fleece dog sweater. For the ugly days of the year.

<strong>Which dog sizes does the sweater fit?</strong>
The sweater is suitable up to the following dimensions:
<strong>Neck circumference:</strong> up to 26cm
<strong>Chest size:</strong> up to 40cm
<strong>Waist:</strong> up to 34cm
<strong>Back length:</strong> up to 30cm

<strong>Why doesn't custom-made products work for particularly small dogs such as Chihuahuas, mini pinschers or small rabbit dachshunds?</strong>
These two breeds of dogs have very small limbs. A sweater in the good Polartec® quality only works for Chihuahuas and mini pinschers in a certain size range, which we have developed in a long, detailed work. Therefore we offer a universal solution here.

<strong>How do I measure my dog?</strong>
Simply measure your neck, chest, waist and back with a flexible tape measure. Everything is explained in detail in our video. We are also happy to help you via Whatsapp if you are unsure about the size! Just write us a message via Whatsapp at 0160-99600256. We are available Mon-Fri from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

<strong> Sporty cut </strong>
The woof &amp; amp; wiggle Polartec® fleece sweater hugs comfortably and ensures a pleasantly cozy feeling and keeps the body warm. But it is also cut in such a way that it does not restrict freedom of movement and is not perceived as annoying. The sweater does not cover the buttocks and so the freedom of the fronds remains unrestricted!

<strong> Water-repellent and breathable </strong>
The woof &amp; amp; wiggle Polartec® fleece pullover is water-repellent, breathable, comfortable to wear and washable!

<strong> Handcrafted from original Polartec® - 100% polyester </strong>
The sweater is made of high quality Polartec® fleece and is hand-made in Hamburg. The color combinations are real eye-catchers and turn a sensible piece of clothing into a real fashion accessory.

<strong> Warning: note for sick or very old dogs </strong>
If your dog suffers from osteoarthritis, paralysis or the like, we recommend our <strong> <a href=""https://woofandwiggle.com/shop/walkandwear-hundebekleendung/hundemantel-wrap-polartec-fleece/""> Polartec Fleece Wrap &lt; / a&gt; </a></strong> for dogs. This is much easier to put on.

106904,"Dog harness ""Santa Monica""","Our vest-shaped dog harness distributes the pulling forces of the leash evenly, thereby reducing the risk of rubbing the dog in one spot. And it also looks very chic in this abstract design. The special thing about this version is that it has a breathable mesh lining, making it perfect for summer.

With adjustable Velcro straps on the neck and chest, our harness is easier to put on but just as safe as many other dog harnesses. By anchoring the Velcro and Velcro hooks, Velcro is one of the strongest fastening methods. We recommend that for the safety and comfort of your dog at least half of the two Velcro parts should lie on top of each other.

107672,"Dog Harness ""Dolce Vita""","Our latest dog harness from the ""Dolce Vita"" collection is probably one of the most beautiful new additions to our shop. The canvas fabric is made of two different yarns and that's why the fabric shines so wonderfully. From the ""Dolce Vita"" collection you will find a suitable dog bag for you or perhaps a beautiful dog bag for your sweetheart.

Our vest-shaped dog harness distributes the pulling forces of the leash evenly, thereby reducing the risk of rubbing the dog in one spot. And it also looks very chic in this abstract design. The special thing about this version is that it has a breathable mesh lining, so it's perfect for summer.

Adjustable Velcro straps at the neck and chest make our harness easier to put on but just as secure as many other dog harnesses. Velcro is one of the strongest fastening methods due to the anchoring of loop tape and Velcro hooks. We recommend that for your dog's safety and comfort, at least half of the two Velcro pieces should be on top of each other.

115403,"Harness coat ""Amsterdam""","Our spring highlight: the harness coat made of high-quality wool blend tweed in shades of yellow and blue. For our new warm spring coat we use a beautiful tweed fabric from Italy. As with our dog harnesses, there is a strap with a D-ring on the top. So you don't need any other harness or collar. The outer material is warm, chic and breathable and also feels very comfortable. The inner lining is soft and light cotton. The coat is perfect for the cool spring days.

Is it a coat for dogs? Is it a dog harness? It's both! We listened to your feedback: A pretty autumn coat combined with our popular harness vest, so with leash attachment. Of course, the velcro holds firmly and securely.

116802,"Poop bag holder ""Explorer""","<p>Who doesn't know it: You're on a hike in the mountains or on a wide beach and there isn't a garbage can in sight. As a conscientious dog owner, you dutifully picked up and packed the dog excrement in a plastic bag. What now? Always carry the plastic bag in your hand? No! This problem is solved with our manure bag holder. Simply attach it to the leash, backpack, pram or any other desired location with the practical carabiner and clamp the poop bag in the elastic band. Everything is already cleared away until the next disposal option.</p>

116880,"Dog Harness ""Bella Italia""","<p>Our vest-shaped dog harness distributes the pulling forces of the leash evenly, thereby reducing the risk of rubbing the dog in one spot. With this ""Bella Italia"" crockery you are ready for your next holiday in Italy or just for a pizza evening at your favorite Italian restaurant.</p>
<p>Adjustable Velcro straps at the neck and chest make our harness easier to put on but just as secure as many other dog harnesses. Velcro is one of the strongest fastening methods due to the anchoring of loop tape and Velcro hooks. We recommend that for your dog's safety and comfort, at least half of the two Velcro pieces should be on top of each other.</p>
<p>The dog harness has a beautiful orange pattern on the outside and an airmesh lining on the inside that allows air to circulate, especially on hot summer days. Get the dishes wet and your dog will also be cooled on hot summer days. </p>
<p>Of course you will also find matching dog bandanas and scrunchies!</p>
