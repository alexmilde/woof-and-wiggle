1177,Tailor-made dog  jumper - Polartec® Fleece,"<strong>Why a jumper for a dog?</strong>
If you hate cold and nasty weather, your dog hates it probably too. Especially small dogs and those with short fur quickly suffer under tough and cold weather conditions. For those days we developed our Polartec® fleece sweater to protect your buddy on those ugly days.

<strong>Sportive &amp; active fit</strong>
The woof &amp; wiggle Polartec® fleece sweater fits tight but flexible to the dogs body, making him feel warm and cozy. We improved the cut for maximum flexibility, so the dog doesn`t experience it as a disruptive. That is why our jumper doesn`t cover the dogs but, for a better agility. For small dogs the woof &amp; wiggle Polartec® Fleece jumper comes with short sleeves and for bigger dogs with long sleeves. If your dog suffers from arthrosis or similar then we recommend our <strong><a href=""https://woofandwiggle.com/shop/walkandwear-hundebekleidung/hundemantel-wrap-polartec-fleece/"">Polartec® Fleece Wrap</a>.</strong>

<strong>How do I put the jumper on my dog?</strong>
With a bit of practice putting on the sweater is quite fast and your dog will love the warm feeling. Simply pull it over his head. Then bend his front legs gently and pull one by one through the opening.

<strong>Waterproof and breathable</strong>
The woof &amp; wiggle Polartec® fleece sweater is absolut rainproof, breathable, comfortable and washable!

<strong>Tailormade out of Polartec®. 100% Polyester!

<strong> Manufacturing </strong>
The chains are hand made in our hamburger woof &amp; amp; wiggle atelier.

<strong> Material </strong>
The collars are equipped with so-called EM ceramic pipes. These are small ceramic tubes that are burned from clay mixed with EM <strong> (Effective Microorganisms) </strong>. EM ceramics builds up an anti-tick environment in dogs.

<strong>Size choice
</strong> The chains are available in 4 different sizes threaded on leather cord. When choosing the size, we recommend using the size of the normal dog collar and not too long.

<strong>Application</strong>
The collar should be worn continuously or as long as possible during the tick season in order to build up good protection. After about four weeks, the collar can also be removed at night. But please note that protection against ticks with alternative means can of course not be 100% guaranteed.

<strong>Care instructions</strong>
For optimal effectiveness against ticks, the collar should be washed with water and dried in the sun every four weeks.",https://woofandwiggle.com/shop/uncategorized/katsuki-em-dog-collar-against-ticks/

Your Chihuahua finds wet and cold just as uncomfortable as you. Because especially small dogs or four-legged friends with short fur suffer quickly from it. That is why we developed our Polartec® fleece dog sweater. For the ugly days of the year.

<strong>Which dog sizes does the sweater fit?</strong>
The sweater is suitable up to the following dimensions:
<strong>Neck circumference:</strong> up to 26cm
<strong>Chest size:</strong> up to 40cm
<strong>Waist:</strong> up to 34cm
<strong>Back length:</strong> up to 30cm

<strong>Why doesn't custom-made products work for particularly small dogs such as Chihuahuas, mini pinschers or small rabbit dachshunds?</strong>
These two breeds of dogs have very small limbs. A sweater in the good Polartec® quality only works for Chihuahuas and mini pinschers in a certain size range, which we have developed in a long, detailed work. Therefore we offer a universal solution here.

<strong>How do I measure my dog?</strong>
Simply measure your neck, chest, waist and back with a flexible tape measure. Everything is explained in detail in our video. We are also happy to help you via Whatsapp if you are unsure about the size! Just write us a message via Whatsapp at 0160-99600256. We are available Mon-Fri from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

<strong> Sporty cut </strong>
The woof &amp; amp; wiggle Polartec® fleece sweater hugs comfortably and ensures a pleasantly cozy feeling and keeps the body warm. But it is also cut in such a way that it does not restrict freedom of movement and is not perceived as annoying. The sweater does not cover the buttocks and so the freedom of the fronds remains unrestricted!

<strong> Water-repellent and breathable </strong>
The woof &amp; amp; wiggle Polartec® fleece pullover is water-repellent, breathable, comfortable to wear and washable!

<strong> Handcrafted from original Polartec® - 100% polyester </strong>
The sweater is made of high quality Polartec® fleece and is hand-made in Hamburg. The color combinations are real eye-catchers and turn a sensible piece of clothing into a real fashion accessory.

<strong> Warning: note for sick or very old dogs </strong>
If your dog suffers from osteoarthritis, paralysis or the like, we recommend our <strong> <a href=""https://woofandwiggle.com/shop/walkandwear-hundebekleendung/hundemantel-wrap-polartec-fleece/""> Polartec Fleece Wrap &lt; / a&gt; </a></strong> for dogs. This is much easier to put on.

<hr />

<strong> How do I put my dog's sweater on? </strong>
With a little practice, it can be dressed very quickly and your dog will love the warmth. Simply pull it over your head and then bend the dog's front legs and pull them through the openings from the front.

103985,"Dog raincoat ""winter anorak""","In Hamburg we are very familiar with ""Shietwetter"". Therefore, we have developed a stylish and functional winter dog anorak in two cool patterns.

Keep your four-legged friend dry and clean with our anorak in the usual woof &amp; wiggle quality.

With the ""Snow Leopard"" design, the hoodie lining and the pocket are made of reflective material. The inner lining of both designs is made of cozy polar fleece and the back is adjustable with an elastic cord in orange or light blue. Of course with a hole for a collar and a pocket with Velcro for snacks on the back.

The jacket is closed with Velcro on the stomach and neck. We use high quality polyester Cordura fabric that is water-repellent and dirt-repellent. The material dries quickly and can be stowed away to save space.

<strong>Easy maintenance</strong>
Care is also very simple: machine washable at 30 ° C, do not tumble dry, do not iron, do not dry clean. It is advisable to renew the impregnation from time to time during the wash cycle.

118463,"Harness coat ""St. Moritz""","<p>Winter will be chic in our tea coat made of high-quality wool blend with a chic fur look in shades of blue, gray and beige. For our new warm autumn coat we use a beautiful, checked coat material from Italy. Like our dog harnesses, there is a webbing with a D-ring on the top. This means you don’t need any additional harness or collar. The outer material is warm, chic and breathable and also feels very comfortable. The inner lining is soft and light made of Tactel.</p>
<p>Is it a coat for dogs? Is it a dog harness? It's both! We listened to your feedback: A pretty autumn coat combined with our popular harness vest, i.e. with a linen fastening. The Velcro is of course secure and secure.</p>
